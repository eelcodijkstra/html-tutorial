## Notes for Programming in Javascript

* We use similar approach as for HTML-0.
* But, Thimble has been replaced by JSBin.
    * The main reasons for this are: (i) separate JS window; (ii) availability of console;

## How to publish the lessons

* the lessons can be published as a static website, with multiple files per lesson.
* for the time being, infvo.com is a suitable environment.
    * publishing is in this case: copying by means of FTP (a little primitive).
    * this environment is under our own control.
* alternative: using GitHub Pages?
* the JSBin-parts are published using JSBin.

## Wishlist

* button on tutorial-frame, to reduce the size (as in HTML-0)

## Notes

* the use of JSBin implies that this material can only be used when internet access is available.
